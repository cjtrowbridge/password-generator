# Password Generator
This simple tool generates very strong passwords which are also very safe.  
  
My main frustration with password generators has been filtering out all the special characters that particular sites dont like. I argue that there is really not any reason to use special characters, this tool uses just upper and lower-case letters and numbers. This still provides extremely high entropy.  
  
Entropy generated with this tool;  
8 characters contain 2.1e18 possible combinations requiring 69 years of guessing at 100k/second in order to bruteforce.  
16 characters contain 4.7e28 possible combinations requiring 1.5e16 years to bruteforce.  
32 characters contain 2.2e57 possible combinations requiring 7.2e44 years to bruteforce. This is about half of the remaining lifespan of the universe before heat death occurs.  
  
I typically use 32 characters for my passwords.
