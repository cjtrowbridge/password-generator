# password-generator
This simple tool generates very strong passwords which are also very safe. 

My main frustration with password generators has been filtering out all the special characters that particular sites dont like. So this one uses just upper and lower-case letters and numbers. This still provides extremely high entropy when you are using more than eight characters. I typically use at least 32 characters for my passwords, providing more than 4e46 possible combinations, and requiring 1.2e34 years of guessing at 100k guesses per second in order to bruteforce.

Navigate to [https://password-generator.cjtrowbridge.com/](https://password-generator.cjtrowbridge.com/) and select a size. It's as easy as that! :]
